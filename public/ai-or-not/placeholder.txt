AI OR NOT - Image Setup Instructions
=====================================

Place your images in this folder with the following naming convention:
- image1.jpg
- image2.jpg
- image3.jpg
... up to image20.jpg (or more)

Then update the imageConfig.ts file to mark which images are AI-generated (isAI: true) 
and which are real photos (isAI: false).

Recommended image sources:
- AI Images: Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion outputs
- Real Images: Unsplash, Pexels, your own photos

Tips for good gameplay:
- Mix different subjects (people, landscapes, objects, animals)
- Include some tricky AI images that look very realistic
- Include some real photos that might look AI-generated
- Use similar resolution/quality for all images
